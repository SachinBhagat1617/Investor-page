              SEVA Connect is a Social Movement that focuses on ESG
              (Environment, Social, Governance) values monitoring, Education on
              ESG values, Green ranking for institutions, and a platform for
              Investors to connect with Sustainability and Social Impact
              projects. Our goal is to challenge the status quo and transform
              society by holding leaders accountable and fighting for solutions.
              Inspired by social movements of the past, SEVA Connect began in
              2023 when a few San Francisco community members decided to
              organize and make an impact. Pretty quickly, this singular moment
              evolved into a full-fledged movement.
